- **Hybrid Architectures**: Seamless integration of classical and quantum components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite ensuring reliability and performance

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coop-columb/quantum-neural-network.git
cd quantum-neural-network
pip install -e .
```

## 🧪 Quick Test

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from quantum_nn.layers import QuantumLayer

# Create a hybrid model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    QuantumLayer(n_qubits=4, measurement_type="expectation"),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train normally - gradients flow correctly!
x = tf.random.normal((10, 8))
y = tf.random.normal((10, 1))
model.fit(x, y, epochs=5)
```

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Core Quantum Layer**: Fully functional with automatic differentiation

## 🏥 Medical Imaging Example

The framework includes specialized components for medical image classification:

```python
from quantum_nn.applications.medical_imaging.models import MedicalQuantumClassifier

# Create medical-specific quantum classifier
classifier = MedicalQuantumClassifier(
    input_shape=(64,),
    n_classes=2,
    n_qubits=8,
    encoding_method="hybrid"
)

# Works with standard TensorFlow training
classifier.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
classifier.fit(medical_data, labels, epochs=10)
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Gradient Flow Resolution
The core issue was that the original quantum layer used `tf.py_function`, which breaks TensorFlow's automatic differentiation. The solution:

1. **Removed** manual gradient computation attempts
2. **Simplified** to use TensorFlow's built-in autodiff
3. **Result**: All operations in the quantum circuit are differentiable

See `GRADIENT_FIX_JOURNEY.md` for the complete technical journey.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Core functionality tests
python test_core_functionality.py

# Full test suite
