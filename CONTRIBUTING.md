## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).  
Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Search existing issues** to ensure the bug hasnâ€™t already been reported.
2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/coop-columb/quantum-neural-network/issues/new) using the "Bug report" template.
3. Provide:
   - A clear, descriptive title.
   - Steps to reproduce (with code snippets or data).
   - Expected and actual behavior.
   - Environment details: OS, Python version, backend (e.g., Qiskit, PennyLane), and framework versions.

### Requesting Features

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a feature request issue using the "Feature request" template.
3. Clearly describe:
   - The problem or opportunity.
   - Proposed solution or API change.
   - Potential use cases and impact.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your own feature branch.
2. Write concise, well-structured, and well-documented code.
3. Ensure all tests pass (`pytest`).
4. Follow code style checks (`black`, `isort`, `mypy`).
5. Add or update documentation and examples.
6. Reference related issues or discussions in your PR description.
7. Submit a pull request against the `main` branch, following the PR template.

**All significant changes (API, internals, or architecture) should be discussed in an issue before opening a PR.**

## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure

- `src/quantum_nn/circuits/`: Quantum circuit templates and parameterized circuits
- `src/quantum_nn/layers/`: Quantum-to-classical neural network layers (TensorFlow integration)
- `src/quantum_nn/models/`: Model architectures (sequential, hybrid, etc.)
- `src/quantum_nn/optimizers/`: Quantum-aware optimizers (parameter-shift, SPSA, etc.)
- `docs/`: Technical and user documentation
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with practical examples
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

### Coding Standards

- **Python 3.10+**  
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) and [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) (type hints).
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for imports.
- Include docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods (Google or NumPy style).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write atomic, testable, and reusable code.
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.

---

## Testing

- All new features and bug fixes must be accompanied by appropriate tests in `tests/`.
- Use `pytest` for running tests and `pytest-cov` for coverage.
- Achieve and maintain high code coverage; target >90%.
- Test classical and quantum backends (Qiskit, PennyLane).
- Run tests locally before submitting.

---

## Documentation

- Update user and developer documentation in `docs/` as needed.
- Public APIs must be documented with usage examples.
- For new features, add or update example notebooks in `notebooks/`.
- Use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for generating documentation.

---

## Community

- Join discussions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/coop-columb/quantum-neural-network/discussions).
- Respond thoughtfully to issues and PR feedback.
- Propose RFCs for major changes (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md`).
