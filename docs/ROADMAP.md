## Vision

Enable scalable, extensible, and reproducible research and development of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models, bridging quantum circuit innovation and real-world machine learning workflows.

---

## Short-Term Goals (v0.2.x)

### Core
- **Enhanced Circuit Library:** Add more diverse quantum circuit templates (e.g., variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) circuits, quantum GANs, hardware-efficient ansätze).
- **Expanded Data Encoding:** Support for custom composite encoding schemes; add more classical-to-quantum data mapping strategies.
- **Optimizer Extensions:** Integrate additional quantum-aware optimizers and meta-learning strategies (e.g., adaptive learning rates, trust region).
- **Improved TensorFlow Integration:** Broader compatibility with Keras functional API, callbacks, and serialization.

### Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive API Reference:** Auto-generate and maintain up-to-date API docs from codebase.
- **Code Quality Automation:** CI for notebook execution, coverage enforcement, and linting.

### Examples and Demos
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** More real-world datasets; quantum transfer learning; adversarial robustness studies.
- **Benchmark Expansion:** Broader set of classical baselines, more datasets, and multi-backend comparisons.

## Mid-Term Goals (v0.3.x)

### Features
- **Real Quantum Hardware Support:** Integrate cloud execution via IBMQ, IonQ, AWS Braket, and others.
- **Custom Circuit Designer UI:** Web-based interface for interactive circuit construction and visualization.
- **Distributed Training:** Add support for distributed hybrid model training (across CPUs/GPUs and quantum hardware).
- **Advanced Visualization:** Interactive tools for visualizing quantum state evolution, entanglement entropy, loss landscapes.

### Research
- **Quantum Kernel Methods:** Implement quantum kernel estimation and hybrid quantum SVMs.
- **Hybrid Attention Mechanisms:** Explore quantum/classical attention architectures.
- **Noise-aware Training:** Tools for training and benchmarking under realistic noise models.

---

## Long-Term Goals (v1.0 and Beyond)

- **Production-Ready Release:** Harden APIs, guarantee backward compatibility, and optimize for performance on both simulation and hardware.
- **Plug-in Ecosystem:** Allow community to easily contribute custom circuits, optimizers, encoders, and backends.
- **Educational Content:** Full curriculum of tutorials and guided labs for quantum machine learning education.
- **Industry Applications:** Demonstrate practical QNN applications in chemistry, finance, and healthcare.

---

## Community Involvement

- **RFCs for Major Changes:** All significant architectural or API changes will be proposed via Request for Comments (RFC) in the repo’s Discussions.
- **Open Issue Tracker:** Feature requests, bug reports, and research ideas are welcome.
- **Mentorship and Collaboration:** We encourage collaborative research and student contributions.
