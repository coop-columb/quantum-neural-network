# Quantum Neural Network Framework â€“ Architecture

This document details the architecture of the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) Framework, describing the core modules, data flow, extensibility points, and integration between quantum and classical machine learning components.

---

## Overview

The QNN framework is designed for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning, enabling flexible model construction, simulation, and benchmarking of quantum neural networks. The architecture supports multiple quantum backends (Qiskit, PennyLane), integrates with TensorFlow for classical machine learning, and provides components for circuit design, data encoding, optimization, and benchmarking.

2. **Encoding:** Data is encoded into quantum states using selected encoding schemes.
3. **Quantum processing:** Encoded data passes through parameterized quantum circuits.
4. **Measurement:** Quantum layer outputs are measured and mapped to classical representations.
5. **Integration:** Quantum outputs are integrated with classical neural network layers.
6. **Optimization:** Training uses quantum-aware optimizers for parameter updates.
7. **Benchmarking:** Model performance is compared against classical baselines.
