# Quantum Neural Network Medical Image Classification Application

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a medical image classification system using quantum neural networks. This application will demonstrate the practical advantages of quantum computing in pattern recognition tasks.

## Application Choice Rationale
Medical image classification was chosen because:
1. **Pattern Complexity**: Medical images contain subtle patterns that benefit from quantum superposition
2. **Feature Entanglement**: Quantum circuits can capture complex correlations between image regions
3. **Real Impact**: Demonstrates practical healthcare applications
4. **Dataset Availability**: Public medical imaging datasets exist for benchmarking
5. **Quantum Advantage**: Potential for improved accuracy with fewer parameters

## Technical Architecture

### Dataset Selection
- **Primary Dataset**: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia Detection)
- **Size**: ~5,000 images (manageable for quantum simulation)
- **Classes**: Binary classification (Normal vs Pneumonia)
- **Image Size**: 224x224 grayscale images, downsampled to 28x28 for quantum processing

### Quantum Architecture Design
```
Input Image (28x28) → Classical CNN Feature Extractor (reduce to 16 features)

            Quantum Circuit Layer 1 (4 qubits, amplitude encoding)
                    ↓
            Quantum Circuit Layer 2 (4 qubits, strongly entangling)
                    ↓
            Classical Dense Layer (16 units)
                    ↓
            Output Layer (Binary Classification)
```
